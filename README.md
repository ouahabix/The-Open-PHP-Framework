The-Open-PHP-Framework
======================

An open PHP framework for everyone and for everything.

I will start putting up the Framework's code bit by bit to ensure a clean and a stable release will be availble for a daily life real problems' solving use.

This Framework will be an extract from my CMS in an attempt to make it more generic and more of a general purpose reliable PHP Rapid library,
which is able to get any PHP developer to start writing his own Web-Application on the fly.

This file is going to be changed quite often to stay up to date with the ongoing development of the project.

I've chosen the LGPL3 License, but this may change in the future to suit the continuity of the project.
